# Default configuration file for sysbuild(1) for user builds.
#
# This default configuration file tells sysbuild to place the NetBSD
# source tree and all build products within the user's home directory.
#
# This file does not assume that the host is NetBSD.  For that reason,
# it cannot automatically determine "valid" settings for some variables
# like MACHINES or GIT_*_BRANCH and therefore only generic values are set.

# Place all build files in the user's home directory.
BUILD_ROOT="${HOME}/netbsd"

# Store release files relative to the build root.
RELEASEDIR="${BUILD_ROOT}/release"

# Place source trees in the home directory as well.
SRCDIR="${BUILD_ROOT}/src"

# Build for the reference machine only.  Add more if desired.
