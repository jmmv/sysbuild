Changes in version 2.8
======================

STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT; NOT RELEASED YET.

* Made the default.conf configuration file not assume a NetBSD host so
  that it is usable, for example, on Mac OS X.  The previous sample
  configuration file has been renamed to NetBSD.conf and is only
  installed when sysbuild is built on NetBSD.

* Fixed default value of SYSBUILD_CONFSUBDIR in configure and a related
  pasto in the INSTALL document.

* Fixed handling of flags in Mac OS X 10.9 due to oddities with the
  built-in /bin/sh (ancient bash).

* Fixed path to sysbuild in sysbuild4cron.


Changes in version 2.7
======================

Released on 2013-07-28.

* Sources migrated to a GitHub project from the previous copy in
  the pkgsrc repository.  sysbuild is now a first-class package and
  includes a traditional build system based on automake and autoconf.


Changes in version 2.6
======================

Released on 2013-06-18.

* Fixed the default configuration file to populate CVSTAG correctly when
  using a CVS/Tag file.

* Ensured that errors from CVS stop execution.


Changes in version 2.5
======================

Released on 2013-03-08.

* Added support for pre/post fetch/build hooks so that, for example,
  rsync can be used to push the results of a successful build to a
  remote server.


Changes in version 2.4
======================

Released on 2012-10-13.

* Added a MKVARS variable to pass arbitrary variables to build.sh through
  -V.  E.g. MKVARS="MKDEBUG=yes".

* Moved the documentation of the configuration file to a new
  sysbuild.conf(5).


Changes in version 2.3
======================

Released on 2012-08-25.

* Added the 'env' command.  This prints a small shell snippet that can
  be imported into the current shell.  The printed code defines a set of
  convenience global variables and functions to work with the source
  tree.


Changes in version 2.2
======================

Released on 2012-08-22.

* Added support to specify per-machine targets by prefixing the targets
  in BUILD_TARGETS by the machine they correspond to.  Useful, for
  example, to build different kernels depending on the machine type.


Changes in version 2.1
======================

Released on 2012-08-15.

* Switched to use shtk for the common utilities and configuration file
  parsing functionality.  The local copies of the "config" and "utils"
  modules are gone.


Changes in version 2.0
======================

Released on 2012-07-25.

* This is the first release of the sysbuild package.  The release is
  numbered 2.0 because 1.x used to exist 10 years ago.  This new release
  shares no code with previous versions and is not compatible with them
  in any way.  The sources of sysbuild were located in the pkgsrc
  repository and sysbuild was only available as a pkgsrc package.


1.x versions
============

sysbuild 1.x existed in pkgsrc from 2002-11-28 to 2004-06-01.  The
package was removed from the tree because NetBSD's build.sh had improved
enough to make the 1.x series of sysbuild unnecessary, and also because
sysbuild 1.x did not work with NetBSD 2.0 and above.

The history of such releases can be checked in the pkgsrc repository if
desired, but the codebase was so different that I have not bothered to
port the notes to this file.
